The difference between *data* and *information* lies in their meanings and how they are used:

1. **Data**:
   - Raw, unprocessed facts and figures.
   - Does not carry any specific meaning until processed.
   - Can be numbers, symbols, or even raw observations (e.g., temperature readings, scores, survey responses).

2. **Information**:
   - Processed, organized, or structured data.
   - Carries meaning, context, and relevance.
   - Helps to answer specific questions or solve problems (e.g., the average temperature over a month, trends in survey results).

**Example**:
   - Data: A list of numbers like `87, 90, 78, 85`.
   - Information: The calculated *average* of these numbers, which may indicate the performance trend of a student over time. 

In essence, *information* is what we get when *data* is analyzed and interpreted to be useful.
